            <p>Chonor House, a branch of Norbulingka, was designed and built by British architect David Porter in a style intended to blend with the natural environment of the hills overlooking the Kangra valley. The stone and slates were obtained from the surrounding hills and carried by mule to the site which was at that time inaccessible to motor vehicles. The shape and location of the building preserved the large pine & cedar trees which dominate the garden and dining area at the back of the building.
            Chonor House is the best place to stay in Mcleod Ganj, conveniently located near the Thekchen Chöling Temple adjacent to HH the Dalai Lama’s residence. Each of our eleven well-appointed rooms is beautifully decorated according to a unique Tibetan theme, with murals featuring regions such as Kham, Amdo and Central Tibet and the flora and fauna of the Land of Snow. These striking wall paintings are complemented by appliquéd fabrics, hand-knotted carpets and carved and decorated wooden furniture, all created by Norbulingka craftsmen.
