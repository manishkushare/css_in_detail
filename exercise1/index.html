            <p class="eight">We are a self-sustaining community located in Dharamsala, India, dedicated to ensuring that the integrity of Tibetan artistic traditions is maintained for generations to come.  Art is a large part of culture, and by maintaining artistic lineages, we help to conserve the unique identity of Tibetans and the sacred traditions which took root in Tibet. Our studios produce museum-quality artwork using methods that have been practiced and passed down for many centuries. We invite visitors to come and explore our beautiful campus and witness firsthand the splendor of Tibetan art.</p>

            <p class="twelve">Norbulingka is a diverse community of over 300 people, they hail from every region of Tibet and the Tibetan diaspora in India, and each individual has a unique story to tell. Our goal  is to give a glimpse into the lives of some of Norbulingka's employees in hopes that people will gain a deeper understanding of Tibetan culture as a whole, and the values, dreams, and struggles of Tibetan people in exile.</p>
